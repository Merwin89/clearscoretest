# clearscoretest

This Github repo consists of two folders:

- ClearScore - Holds the code for the automation test script for Test 1 and Test 3
- ClearScore Q&A - Contains the answers for the questions along with a Postman collection for Test 2

Test Scripts
I have used the Eclipse editor for coding the scripts
The same can be imported directly to Eclipse and run using the Run button.
There are two classes:
1. TestMain - The main class
2. Signup - The class for the signup related test cases

A file named "ClearScoreCookies.data" is created and will contain the clear score cookies names and values in it. This list can then be verified against available data.


Known Issues: On running as TestNG project the Signup class fails. It runs when run in normal mode.
