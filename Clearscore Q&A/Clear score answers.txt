1. How would you integrate the tests you have written into a continuous integration environment?
 - Cover the most important regression cases
 - Integrate them to a CI tool so that the tests are run automatically on every push from developers
 - This should run separately for the Staging and Production environments

2. How would you make your API test simulate being as realistic a user as possible?
 - Test with realistic data
 - Use different browsers
 -  Use delays to simulate think time
 - Test with different network speeds
 -  Multiple requests like an impatient user
 - Load test with sudden spikes and troughs
 - Add load slowly and steadily
 - Hit the api with a huge number of requests within a shot span of time

3. How would you approach running the same tests across mobile devices and different browsers? 
 - Cross browser testing can be handled by Selenium and the same test can be run for various browsers
 - There are other tools available in teh market too with allow a tester to do this
 - Mobile devices are a but difficult since there are lots of parameters like processor, memory, screen size, OS etc
 - Emulators can be used for testing on mobile devices
